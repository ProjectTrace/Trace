PURPOSE
\n\nThe purpose of this research is to investigate the ways in which you use mapping tools to move
through public life. We are interested in understanding those experiences of movement (such as walking)
and intimate communication in public life. We are also interested in exploring opportunities for emerging
technologies or technologies that are not yet developed that may be useful for your purposes.

\n\nParticipants of this study will be observed and participating with researchers, surveyed about
their practice, interviewed about their relationship to their community, friends and family,
and/or asked to use a set of tools for one or more hours.

\n\nYou are being asked to participate because you are 18 years of age and a member of a community organization
in Seattle, WA.

\n\nPROCEDURES
\n\nAs a participant in this research, you are volunteering to take part using the Trace application
for a length of time of your choosing.

\n\nRISKS
\n\nWe do not expect our study to involve more than minimal risk; therefore, the possibility of
unanticipated adverse events would be minimal. Possible risks or discomforts could arise from not
being able to complete a task, learning a new set of interactive features, or standard risks associated
with using a map to navigate a neighborhood. You should use override the application\'s routing
instructions at any point along your path and use your best judgement while following the instructions.
Negative outcomes pose a minimal risk to subjects and will be managed on the spot by the individual
investigator and the TAT Lab staff assisting with the experiment.

\n\nBENEFITS
\n\nYour participation in this research will also aid in the design and development of technologies
for navigation and communication.

\n\nSOURCE OF FUNDING
\n\nThe study team and/or the University of Washington is receiving financial support from the
National Science Foundation (NSF).

\n\nCONFIDENTIALITY
\n\nSeveral steps will be followed to keep your personal information confidential in this study.
